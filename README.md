# Data-interaction-application

# Problem Statement:

To develop a command line interface which retrieves queries from the user and processes the query using a json database.

# Use Case:

This project uses a Hospital case study with patient and doctor data. Queries related to patients, doctors and problems routed to doctors can be addressed by the system by Intent Recognition and Query Handling.

# Example:

- “Patients”: [{“ID”:101, “Name”: “Daisy”, “Age”: 21, “Problem”: “Fever”}]
- “Doctors”: [{“ID”: 201, “Name”: “Danna”, “Specialization”: “Physician”}]

# Project File Structure:

- [app.py](app.py): The main Python script.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): File listing project dependencies.
- [README.md](README.md): The project README file.

# Installation:

In terminal, “pip install -r requirements.txt” – downloads all necessary libraries with their versions for running the code

# Execution:

On command line, execute script for “app.py”.
Enter queries and to exit the system, type “quit”.
